        <strong>Welcome to the Logging & Threat Detection Assessment</strong><br><br>
        This assessment evaluates your organization's implementation of security controls based on 
        <strong>Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) v2</strong>, focusing specifically on 
        <strong>Logging and Threat Detection</strong> controls.<br><br>

        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Logging and threat detection enable organizations to identify, investigate, and respond to security incidents 
        before they escalate into full-scale breaches. Continuous monitoring, behavioral analytics, and centralized correlation across identity, network, 
        data, and application layers are required to detect multi-stage attacks. Organizations implementing comprehensive logging and threat detection 
        achieve rapid incident response and forensic readiness, while those neglecting these controls face prolonged adversary dwell time, undetected 
        privilege escalation, and inability to reconstruct breach timelines.<br><br>

        <strong>Risks if not implemented:</strong> Undetected threats for extended periods, incomplete forensic evidence preventing incident reconstruction, 
        and regulatory compliance gaps.<br><br>

        <strong>Core pillar:</strong> Enable detection capabilities: Deploy intelligent detection systems that continuously monitor for known attack patterns, 
        anomalous behaviors, and indicators of compromise across all critical resource types (compute, data, identity, network).<br><br>
